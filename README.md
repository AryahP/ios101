## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Adobe 
- drop images in the application and display on the screen
- allow the user to change properties of the image via drop-down menus
  
Instagram
- vanish messages with swipe-up
- Create an account that connects to a separate database
  
Duolingo
- embed audio files
- process input audio, map to application text, and say whether the text is correct

  
Photos App
- Generate click sound
- Add timer before taking a picture
- Zoom in and out using fingers
  
Personal App Brainstorming
An app that showcases and creates a well-balanced diet plan for celiac disease individuals. It makes updates to the diet plan as the week goes on
depending on what the individual has consumed previously. Upload the image of the food and it will display the ingredients or lead to the website
where the product is made. The app will allow celiac disease individuals to quickly see where different products are located across a region or
lead them to the website where they can order it. Any blood test results or updates will also change the meal plan. 

## Notes

I was trying to implement functionality for textField such that a keyboard enter would trigger output; I realized that it would require something other than UI and importing other statements; 
upon importing Cocoa, the suggested input text, I still could not fix the issue and proceeded to use a button.
